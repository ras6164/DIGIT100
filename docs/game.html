	  <h1>Game Review</h1>
	  <p>Daring Academy is an indie game developed by the user Thediamondcrystal. It takes place in a small college town called Olis in which you and your best friend, Amelia, have recently moved there to go to school. The game takes oneself upon a journey of college life with a focus on creating relationships. Its scoring mechanisms focus on the building of emotions and connections with points being earned for improved “love” and “trust” ratings throughout the scenes. As of now, the game is quite limited and only features a total of 4 scenarios but will be expanded to include more scenes and the meeting of new people such as Lily, Rose, and Dominick in future versions.</p>
<p>The game is designed to be an immersive and interactive experience for the player. At the start, it prompts the player for a name to allow for you to feel as if you are in the world. In addition to this, the game is a first-person experience in which you can only see other characters, but never see yourself. You are only allowed to control yourself, and never switch to control other characters. This is limited to a certain extent due to the rigidness of picking basic options that controls where you go as many conversations are still automated /you continuously click through them which makes the world feel closed off. However, in future versions the adding of new options and decision points will further improve this and increase the designer’s realism goal.</p>

<p>Figure 1 demonstrates how the user can input decisions. Throughout the scenes, the game uses a series of prompts to allow the player to decide what to do next. Clicking on different options allows one to interact with other characters and objects within the game. These include deciding where to go for food, what to eat, and how to handle challenges (in future development). In its current state, most of the game is based on choices interacting with other characters, the only objects the character can interact with is related to food consumption.</p>

<p>Depending on the choices made, different points can be earned, and it creates differing reactions from the NPCs in the game. For example, if one is to choose a restaurant Amelia likes (Pizza/Thai Breakers), you earn additional trust points. This could be later developed into the challenges of the game in which picking different options will cause the loss of points. It did take several gameplays to realize how different restaurant choices increased the scores, so this can be viewed as a “mini challenge”, but ultimately appears to have little effect on the game. I have mixed feelings about the developer adding a load function to the game that allows for one to go back to any decision point. This allows for one to easily view the effect of other options, but also decreases the challenge of picking the right option if you can simply go back and change it in 2 clicks. 
Figure 2 demonstrates how it is displayed you have earned points in the game. In its current state, the game does not have many differing options yet, but it is an interesting concept for a game that will improve over time. Below, is a network of all possible decisions in the current game and the points earned by selecting them.</p>

<p>The graphics are static but are a medium level of quality. They make use of a wide range of colors that are paired with detailed shading and gradients, but still come off as basic compared to modern games. There are 3 different sets of settings that are featured—dorm, restaurant, and a city at night. Amelia can move her eyes and mouth, but is limited to only that. I believe the developer opted to leave some details out to further the ability for you to feel a connection to the game—an overbearing number of details in the graphics would delineate its goal of making it feel like your college experience and diminish its ability to form a personal connection to you. </p>

<p>Upon the competition of a significant milestone, the game displays a graphic in the upper right of the screen. Thus far, these are the only notifications that occur outside of the ones on the bottom of the screen and are only temporary. Figure 3 shows the achievement notification for completing the first day of the game. It is unknown if these contribute to the final scoring of the game as I was not notified that any “trust” or “love” points were earned after it unlocked.</p>

<p>In further development of the game, additional characters will be added. Lily, Rose, and Dominick are expected to be other college students you will be able to form friendships with in additional to Amelia. As the game is still under development, has yet to include those so it is quite limited in the ability to interact with others currently. The only other NPCs you see in the game are those that work at the restaurant, which are static conversations that you have little interaction with. Figure 4 shows one of these characters. An interesting note is to make is the complexity and detail the developer placed on the creation of the characters in the restaurant. They opted for an extravagant dressed individual, compared to all other characters that are simply dressed. I am not sure why the developer included the character in that state as the setting for the scene takes place at a pizza restaurant in a college town. </p>

<p>While the game has a solid start in its development so far, there are a couple of areas I see room for improvement. The scoring itself is not well explained, you just suddenly start earning “trust” and “love” at a certain point in the game. It is difficult to keep track of these as there is no running total displayed on the screen and the player is not aware of the effect they have on the likelihood of winning/completing the game. There is no known way to lose points, despite the game clearly stating decisions made affect the outcome of the game early on. I think in later versions, this will be the main challenge--the ability to make choices that are beneficial to forming friendships and earn points. In addition to this, the game features a couple of bugs throughout it that display in red text in the upper left of the screen. Figure 5 shows one example of when this happened. While these errors appear to not harm the gameplay in any way, they are quite jarring on the user to see randomly popup on the screen. </p>
<p>Overall, I think the game has decent potential and it will be interesting to see it add in challenges via additional decision points/characters in future development. This will further enhance the playability of it and allow one to explore the world and the weights of different choices made. In its current state, the game is very basic, but it is worth giving a shot if you are interested in realistic games with structured, logic-based decisions. </p>
