	  <h1>Game Review</h1>
	  <p>Daring Academy is an indie game developed by the user Thediamondcrystal. It takes place in a small college town called Olis in which you and your best friend, Amelia, have recently moved there to go to school. The game takes oneself upon a journey of college life with a focus on creating relationships. Its scoring mechanisms focus on the building of emotions and connections with points being earned for improved “love” and “trust” ratings throughout the scenes. As of now, the game is quite limited and only features a total of 4 scenarios but will be expanded to include more scenes and the meeting of new people such as Lily, Rose, and Dominick in future versions. </p>

	  <h1>Corpus Analysis Essay</h1>
	  <p>When comparing former President Donald Trump and current President Joe Biden, it is evident the differing policy decisions and ideals of the country, but that begs the question: do such differences translate to contrasts in the analysis of linguistic trends and word choice. In order to identify potential variance, two collections of transcripts will be analyzed by looking at a frequency distribution of both individual words (Voyant Tools) and common phrases known as n-grams (AntConc). The first collection includes a comparison of an early Donald Trump Covid-19 press briefing taking place on March 14, 2020, and an early Joe Biden Covid-19 press briefing as president taking place on January 21, 2021. The second collection attempts to normalize the findings by adding 4 additional campaign speeches for each candidate delivered at similar timeframes prior to the 2020 election.  </p>

	  <h1>Comparative Website Essay</h1>
	  <p>WordPress/Webflow and static HTML are two of the most popular methods to develop a website, both of which, contain significant advantages and disadvantages depending on its purpose. WordPress/Webflow are both a content management system (CMS) and can allow for the creation of a website in less time, without the need to manually write code. While this lowers some barriers to entry such as knowing how to write HTML/CSS, paying for hosting/domains, and downloading/paying for expensive coding editors, it still forces the use of an overcomplicated graphic user interface (GUI) that come with its own challenges of attempting to fight with the interface to make desired changes. With such a large number of websites using a universal platform, it increases the chances for cybersecurity risks and furthers the injection of outsider code and grants permission rights to unknown developers at times. This poses an advantage for static HTML pages. As nearly all content is tested and written in-house, it ensures that malicious lines of code are not snuck in with the unknowns of what is truly being modified in the code once the “activate” button is pressed. </p>

<p>While a CMS may require some additional clicks to actually produce the desired results, one can still rapidly change the look and feel of a site dynamically by implementing a theme, which can save many hours of transferring content in an HTML editor. While one must acknowledge the ease of implementing global CSS settings in changing the look and feel of a site, there is nothing quite as easy as pressing activate in a GUI-based environment as offered from a CMS....</p>
